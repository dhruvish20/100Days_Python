                                        RANDOM MODULE

random module in python uses Mersenne_Twister algorithm to generate random numbers.

to random generate integeres between a specific range we can use :
  ranom.randit(a, b)

to generate a random floating point number between 0 to 1 we can use:
    random.random()

if you want to generate random number from specificranaae starting from 0 ,
all you can do is to multiply the maximum range with the output of random.random() func.
    random number between o to 5 :
    number = random.random()* 5

if you have a list and you want to choose any random index from that list you can choose:
    random.choice(list_name)

where if you want to randoml shuffle your data than you can simply do:
    random.shuffle 
    p.s = you don't need to store the values while using above 2 random operations
