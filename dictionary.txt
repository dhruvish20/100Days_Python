                                            DICTIONARY

programming_dictionary = {
    "Bug": "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.", 
    "Function": "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again."
}

we can simply call the items in the dictionary by calling its key.

#example:

print(programming_dictionary["Bug"])

#output:

An error in a progran that prevents the program from running as expected.

To add a new valur in the dictionary we can just do :

programming_dictionary["Loop"] = "Need we we want to iterate over and over."

SO this will add new key "Loop" in the dictionary with its string value.

#besides this we should use proer datatype of the key while calling it, we have to check
wheather it is string or numeric value and use datatype accordingly.

## Loop through the f=dictionary:

for key in programming_dictionary:
    print(key)                           ====> this whill print bug , function i.e the key name from the dictionary 
    print(programming_dictioanry[key])   ====> this wil print the value of the key form the dictionary

to add new items into the dictionary we can use .append().
