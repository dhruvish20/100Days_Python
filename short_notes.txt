Docstring is used to give proper documentation of the function 
and how its works when we hover on the function.

##example:
def whathisfuncdo(a , b):

GLOBLE VARIABLE:

if i want to modify global variable in a local scope , than i need to use globa keyword inside the scope

##example:

number = 1 

def func():
    global number
    number = 2
    return number  

print(def func())   ====> this will print 2 and this is how we can change global variable in local scope
