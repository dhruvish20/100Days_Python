and how its works when we hover on the function.

    global number
    number = 2
    return number  

print(def func())   ====> this will print 2 and this is how we can change global variable in local scope

You can't make empty class or empty function after defining it like :

class Class:

obj = Class() ----------> this will give an indentation error. 


while you can make use of the keyword pass to define the empty class or function

clas Class():
    pass

obj = Class() ----------------> this will not give you an error.
